# Deploy a CentOS based Slurm cluster

This template deploys a Slurm cluster using CentOS 7.7 or CentOS-HPC (RDMA for Infiband network in image). 

The default compute node choice is Standard_D8s_v3 which requires CentOS as the OS choice. Use CentOS-HPC if using H16r or H16mr.  It's setup to support v2 VM images only.

The template also sets up an NFS share on the master node at /data and it shared and mounted on the compute nodes at the same location, and uses this partition for home directories too.

## Using the cluster

SSH to the master node using your AD credentials then do a srun or sbatch submission. The DNS name is is generated by the template and returned as a template output that can be viewed in the portal or by looking at the deployment outputs.
