# Deploy an Ubuntu based Slurm cluster

This template uses Ubuntu 16.04-LTS. If you choose H16r or H16mr as your image you will have to install and configure the RDMA drivers. This template also comfigures data disks at /data and shares it out to the compute nodes over NFS where it is mounted in the same location.
